# Iodine / Chemical . Male . 17yrsold

## You may have seen me in roleplays because that's all I do in Ponytown besides sitting at docks making skins. I am big into making ocs and animations, it's a passion of mine.

### Basic DNI : Discrimators, drama in general [It gets overwhelming], and just problematic stuff. I will not hesitate to hide you or block your messages.

### INT : Fellow roleplayers, artist, honestly just anybody who isn't on the DNI list! 

## Anyways! I am horrible at English but I can manage my spelling or understanding in speech, sucks. Oh yeah, I did mention I love making ocs! If you want to see more feel free to join me in roleplays or you can check out my Toyhouse linked to the github! My main OC is Ashida so far.

## Heres a little bit about Ashida, if you'd like to know more feel free to whisper me or join SC! : Ashida is known as the god of blood, trapped away for his recklessness and instanity that leaks into his mind. His birth place was in Arril, basically the holy land we know as heaven. His father being Chessire the god of renewity and wisdom. His mother being Varien! The god of chaos, that's where most of Ashida's traits were inherited from. Ashida has two forms, his god form which is disturbing, I'd rather describe someone his form with permission so if you want to whisper go ahead! His other form which is in most of my drawings and who I roleplay on ponytown is his human vessel!
