# Iodine / Chemical . Male . 17yrsold

## You may have seen me in roleplays because that's all I do in Ponytown besides sitting at docks making skins. I am big into making ocs and animations, it's a passion of mine.

### Basic DNI : Discrimators, drama in general [It gets overwhelming], and just problematic stuff. I will not hesitate to hide you or block your messages.

### INT : Fellow roleplayers, artist, honestly just anybody who isn't on the DNI list! 

## Anyways! I am horrible at English but I can manage my spelling or understanding in speech, sucks. Oh yeah, I did mention I love making ocs! If you want to see more feel free to join me in roleplays or you can check out my Toyhouse linked to the github! My main OC is Ashida so far. I GO FERAL WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING LORE AND WORLDBUILDING!

## Speaking of wordbuilding! This is what I have for Ashida and his world so far! 

# Worldbuilding

### Down on Earth people believe in only 3 gods, the time god, the god of life, and god of death. These gods were said to be the creators of Earth. In the beginning of time it was just empty and endless. Then time split into this world, days and nights, past and futures, beginnings and endings. Along with the moon and sun being created to go along with this all. Once time set his rhythm then came in life. Wherever her footsteps fell, flowers bloomed, rivers were born, and from her breath made the first humans to roam this Earth. Life without death would choke itself. So death stepped forth, coming in when she was needed. She started illnesses, complications in life but it was only to keep things fair. Life is not that easy. 

### Those 3 gods were believed to be the only gods in existence to complete the circle. Time gave motion, life gave being, and death gave rest. There was a festival for the gods held on the winter solstice. It is held at The Great Monetery, it is a site said to be the place where Time, Life, and Death first touched Earth. People prayed, danced, and had fun. It was a day of remembrance but also a day to be thankful for being alive.

### The thing was there were never 3 gods that gave Earth its beauty. There were four. This god was left out in stories but there was one guy who’d speak about there being a fourth god. The people thought he was crazy but no no, he was indeed correct. This guy who said there was a fourth god is named Herlando. The first human on Earth. But how come he’s alive still? Some call it a miracle, others find it creepy, but Herlando calls it science. Refusing to elaborate. 

### Herlando was correct. When he was placed on Earth he did see the gods with his own eyes, greeting him. There were 3 tall gods standing above him like pillars of enternity and then there was this smaller..fragile one hugging onto the god of life's robe. His eyes gleamed too bright, his smile too wide for someone so young. Herlando had no clue who the little one was or if he was even a god. Though, he had that memory carved into his mind forever. Especially that child. After that day he started researching. He’d begin to piece things together, clues…proof anything he can get his hands on. He pondered..life gave breath, death gave rest, time gave motion..but what gave- He stared at his own hand and with the edge of his broken quill he cut it thin slice on his palm and froze.

### Red, warm, and flowing.

### It pulsed in rhythm with his heart. It carried his strength, his very essence. Without it, flesh was nothing but husk Then suddenly, it struck him. “Life, Death, and time..but what of this?” This red liquid that flows from his palm… is no gift of theirs. He remembered the child god clinging to the hem of the Life goddess’s robe. That strange light in his eyes, the way Herlando’s chest had gone cold when those eyes locked onto his. He understood, at last, why the priests never spoke of him, why his name had been erased in books, voices, tales... The others had given the framework of existence, but this child had given blood.

### He is forgotten yet he is in them.
